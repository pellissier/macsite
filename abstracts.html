	  <i>Monetary Economics Simulation: Stock-Flow Consistent Invariance,
	    Monadic Style.</i> <br />
	    An agent-based simulation of a monetary economy as a whole should be
	    stock-flow consistent. We aim at providing a compile-time
	    verification of the preservation of this invariant by the
	    computation. We guarantee this invariant by wrapping the accounting
	    operations in a monad. Our objective is to increase the confidence
	    in the SFCness of an existing complex simulation with a minimal
	    refactoring of code.

	  <i>The dynamics of leverage in a Minskyan model with
	    heterogeneous firms.</i> <br />
	  This paper introduces
	    heterogeneous microeconomic behavior into a demand-driven
	    macroeconomic model in order to study the joint dynamics
	    of leverage and capital accumulation. By identifying the
	    links between firm level variables and aggregate
	    quantities, the paper contributes toward a reformulation
	    of the Minskyan formal analysis that explicitly considers
	    the role of microeconomic factors in generating
	    macroeconomic instability. The aggregation of
	    heterogeneous agents is not only performed numerically, as
	    in traditional agent-based models, but also by means of an
	    innovative analytical methodology, originally developed in
	    statistical mechanics and recently imported into
	    macroeconomics. The distinctive feature is in that the
	    joint analysis of the numerical and analytical solutions
	    of the model sheds light on the effects of financial
	    fragility at the firm level on the dynamics of the
	    macroeconomy. In particular, the analysis of steady-state
	    and stability properties of the system provide additional
	    insights on the role of behavioral and size heterogeneity of firms for the stocks of aggregate debt and capital.

	  <i>Stock-flow consistent models and European imbalances.</i>
	  <br />
            This paper presents a Keynesian model which describes
            three countries trading merchandise and financial assets
            with one another. It is initially assumed that all three
            countries have independent fiscal policies but that two of
            the countries share a currency, hence the model can be
            used to make a preliminary analysis of the conduct of
            economic policy in ‘the eurozone’ vis-à-vis the rest of
            the world—‘the USA’. The main conclusion will be that, if
            all three countries do indeed operate independent fiscal
            policies, the system will work under a floating currency
            regime, but only so long as the European central bank is
            prepared to modify the structure of its assets by
            accumulating an ever rising proportion of bills issued by
            any ‘weak’ euro country.

	  <i>Intelligent escalation.</i> <br /> Escalation is a
	  typical feature of infinite games. Therefore tools con-
	  ceived for studying infinite mathematical structures, namely
	  those deriv- ing from coinduction are essential. Here we use
	  coinduction, or back- ward coinduction (to show its
	  connection with the same concept for finite games) to study
	  carefully and formally the infinite games especially those
	  called dollar auctions, which are considered as the paradigm
	  of escalation. Unlike what is commonly admitted, we show
	  that, provided one assumes that the other agent will always
	  stop, bidding is rational, because it re- sults in a subgame
	  perfect equilibrium. We show that this is not the only
	  rational strategy profile (the only subgame perfect
	  equilibrium). Indeed if an agent stops and will stop at
	  every step, we claim that he is ratio- nal as well, if one
	  admits that his opponent will never stop, because this
	  corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium. Amazingly, in
	  the infinite dollar auction game, the behavior in which both
	  agents stop at each step is not a Nash equilibrium, hence is
	  not a subgame perfect equilibrium, hence is not
	  rational. The right notion of rationality we obtain fits
	  with common sense and experience and remove all feeling of
	  paradox.
